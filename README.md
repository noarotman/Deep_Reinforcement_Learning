# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning
 Teach a quadcopter how to fly by using reinforcement learning.
 
This is the last project for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

The project goal is to design an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then train it by using a reinforcement learning algorithm.
The algorithm is based on deep deterministic policy gradients(DDPG).
